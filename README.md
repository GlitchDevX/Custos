# Custos
Custos is a User Content Moderation System which aims to prevent spam and helps to moderate users.

It consists of three parts. A Web UI to manage the application and check flagged users. An API where user content can be checked in real time. And a pipeline to flag reported user messages with the power of an LLM.

The tech stack is `Python` with `Flask` and `Nuxt`.

## Local Development
To develop locally, start the docker compose file to be able to access the db.
